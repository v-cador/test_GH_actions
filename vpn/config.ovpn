# The server you are connecting to is using a circuit in order to separate entry IP from exit IP
# The same entry IP allows to connect to multiple exit IPs in the same data center.

# If you want to explicitly select the exit IP corresponding to server US-FREE#58 you need to
# append a special suffix to your OpenVPN username.
# Please use "HQKxTIxPo5zTr62P+b:0" in order to enforce exiting through US-FREE#58.

# If you are a paying user you can also enable the ProtonVPN ad blocker (NetShield) or Moderate NAT:
# Use: "HQKxTIxPo5zTr62P+b:0+f1" to enable anti-malware filtering
# Use: "HQKxTIxPo5zTr62P+b:0+f2" to additionally enable ad-blocking filtering
# Use: "HQKxTIxPo5zTr62P+b:0+nr" to enable Moderate NAT
# Note that you can combine the "+nr" suffix with other suffixes.
